    <h3>DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, & <br> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY & INTEGRATION</h3>
    <p>
      The first stage of our development cycle consists of analyzing a 
      project's scope to design a linear workflow around it, aiming for 
      completion within the client's time-frame and budget. Complex tooling 
      often requires a myriad of finely-tuned and optimized services working in 
      unison. <b>{{.AppName}}</b>

        creates, deploys, and maintains these services, and helps teams do the 
        same</a>. Our product delivery process implements a continuous 
      integration and deployment pipeline, automating and streamlining builds, 
      tests, security audits, version control, backups, staging, deployments, 
      and other workflow mechanisms, using state-of-the-art cloud-based 
      solutions, microservices, and unique, custom tooling, to quickly and 
      reliably deliver fully functional products to end-users.
