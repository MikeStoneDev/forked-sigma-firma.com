    <h3>ABOUT <b>{{.AppName}}</b></h3>
    <p class="aboutP">
      <b>{{.AppName}}</b> is an advanced software and consulting firm operating at
      the intersection of technological innovation and strategic business
      transformation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Specializing in full stack project 
      development, management, and consultation, {{.AppName}} can design, create, 
      and deploy web, cloud, and server based applications in as little as minutes, 
      and for less than you think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, our development cycle consists of a multi-step process which starts by 
      analyzing a projects scope, and designing a linear workflow for 
      completing the project within a clients time-frame and budget. This may 
      include pre-project planning such as building a development team (if 
      necessary) and procurement of essential resources. After the planning 
      phase, the project is built to the clients exact specifications, tested, 
      and finally deployed, using state-of-the-art cloud-based deployment solutions. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Our skills also include devOps, 
      microservices, component based architectures, and continuous integration
      and delivery systems for industry leaders seeking custom
      solutions for critical infrastructure optimizations.

    <h3>DATA ANALYSIS?</h3>
    <p>
      Data analysis is the process of analyzing and 
      transforming data. Our company can help your company 
      create tools that pull data from digital sources, 
      analyze it, and perform operations on it. This type 
      of tooling can be used to keep track of statistics 
      that can change how your company performs, ultimately 
      creating long-term and achievable avenues of revenue. 
    </p>

    <!-- <h3>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h3> -->
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   {{.AppName}} generally plans for a component based --> 
    <!--   architecture, either directly through template composition or with a third --> 
    <!--   party framework such as React. All projects are designed for long term -->
    <!--   growth and simple maintenance. -->
    <!--   New projects are designed using the Go programming language for the --> 
    <!--   back-end architecture. --> 
    <!-- </p> -->

    <h3>DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, AND <br> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY/INTEGRATION</h3>

    <p>
      Most projects only expose a small percentage of their scope.
      To function properly, complex tooling may require many services working
      in sync. Our company can design, create, deploy, and maintain these 
      services, or help your team in doing so. We implement continuous delivery
      and integration systems by planning and building microservices for every
      action required by a companies workflow, 
      including unit testing, security auditing, version control, data redundancy, 
      staging, deployment, and whatever other actions are required to 
      reliably deliver a functional product.
