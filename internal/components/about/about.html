    <h3>ABOUT <b>{{.AppName}}</b></h3>
    <p class="aboutP">
      <b>{{.AppName}}</b> is an advanced software development and consulting 
      firm, operating at the intersection of technological innovation and 
      strategic business transformation. Specializing in full stack project 
      development, management, and consultation, {{.AppName}} can design, 
      create, and deploy local, web, cloud, and server based applications in as
      little as minutes, and for less than you think. We target industry 
      leaders seeking custom solutions for optimizing and enhancing critical 
      infrastructure components. Our development cycle starts with analyzing a 
      project's scope to design a linear workflow for reaching completion 
      within a client's time-frame and budget. Our product delivery process is 
      streamlined via continuous integration and deployment pipelines, which 
      build, test, and deploy products, instantly, using custom tooling and 
      state-of-the-art cloud-based solutions.

    <h3>DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, AND <br> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY/INTEGRATION</h3>
    <p>
        Most projects only expose a small percentage of their scope. To 
        function properly, complex tooling may require many services working in
        sync. Our company specializes in designing, creating, deploying, and 
        maintaining these services, and helping teams do the same. Continuous 
        delivery and integration systems are implemented by planning and 
        building microservices for every action required by a workflow, 
        including unit testing, security auditing, version control, data 
        redundancy, staging, deployment, and whatever other actions are 
        required to reliably deliver a functional product.
    </p>

    <h3>DATA ANALYSIS?</h3>
    <p>
        Data mining is the process of collecting and extracting data. Data 
        analysis is the process of analyzing and transforming data into useful,
        valuable information. Our company can help your company build tools for
        data mining and analysis, capable of revealing valuable insights, 
        hidden statistics, and sustainable, long-term and achievable avenues of
        revenue.
