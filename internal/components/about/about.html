    <h3>ABOUT <b>{{.AppName}}</b></h3>
    <p class="aboutP">
      <b>{{.AppName}}</b> is an advanced software and consulting firm operating at
      the intersection of technological innovation and strategic business
      transformation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We specialize in full stack project 
      development, management, and consultation, and can design, create, 
      and deploy web, cloud, and server based applications in as little as minutes, 
      and for less than you think. Additionally, we specialize in devOps, 
      microservice and component based architectures, and continuous delivery
      and integration systems for companies and organizations seeking custom
      solutions for internal or cloud based software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically, our development cycle consists of a multi-step process which starts with 
      analyzing the projects scope and designing a linear workflow for 
      completing the project within a clients time-frame and budget. This may 
      include pre-project planning such as building a development team (if 
      necessary) and procurement of essential resources. After the planning 
      phase, the project is built to the clients exact specifications, tested, 
      and finally deployed, using state-of-the-art cloud-based deployment solutions. 
    </p>

    <h3>DATA ANALYSIS?</h3>
    <p>
      Data analysis is the process of analyzing and 
      transforming data. Our company can help your company 
      create tools that pull data from digital sources, 
      analyze it, and perform operations on it. This type 
      of tooling can be used to keep track of statistics 
      that can change how your company performs, ultimately 
      creating long-term and achievable avenues of revenue (profits). 
    </p>

    <!-- <h3>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h3> -->
    <!-- <p> -->
    <!--   {{.AppName}} generally plans for a component based --> 
    <!--   architecture, either directly through template composition or with a third --> 
    <!--   party framework such as React. All projects are designed for long term -->
    <!--   growth and simple maintenance. -->
    <!--   New projects are designed using the Go programming language for the --> 
    <!--   back-end architecture. --> 
    <!-- </p> -->

    <h3>DEVOPS, MICROSERVICES, AND <br> CONTINUOUS DELIVERY/INTEGRATION</h3>

    <p>
      Most projects only expose a small percentage of their scope to the client.
      For a complex project to function properly it may require many services working
      in tandem and in-sync, unbeknownst to the client. Our company can design, 
      create, deploy, and maintain these services, or help your team in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continuous delivery and integration is implemented 
      by planning and building microservices for each action needed for an
      individual companies CI/CD workflow, 
      including unit tests, security audits, version control and backups, 
      staging, final deployment, and whatever other actions deemed necessary. 
    </p>
